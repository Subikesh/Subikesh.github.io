                    Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. 
                    Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
                    Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality,
                    and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.

                    At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (1911 – 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love".
                    Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk 
                    some years previously.
